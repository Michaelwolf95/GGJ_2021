v1.2
    Changed builtin BlobShadow shader's minimum Shader Model version to 3.0, from 4.7.
    Fixed a compile error in the AmplifyBlobShadow shader of the URP version.
    Fixed zeroed-out default values for the BlobShadowGraph shader in the URP version.
    Forced disable batching on the Builtin version of the shader, to prevent accidental breaking.

v1.1
    Added EnableDepthTexture.cs script, to fix issues where none of the blob shadows show up because of a disabled depth texture.
    Added FollowObject.cs script, for simple attachment of the shadow geo to an object with a world-relative offset.
    Added Rounded Cube Bias and Rounded Cube Power parameters to the shader to allow for softer cube shadows.
    Added UV-less and normal-less shadow cube mesh to use for minimum rendering cost. 
    Changed the culling and Z-testing so that the shadow volume is visible even when the camera is inside. (Thanks AtomicJoe!) Unfortunately this apparently can't be done in URP yet.
    Improved the example scene with better examples and text descriptions.
    Fixed issue with shader not interacting properly with fog.
    Fixed issue with cube-to-sphere values still being calculated when Allow Shape Blending is disabled.
    Fixed ASEMaterialInspector warning.

v1.0
    Initial release.
